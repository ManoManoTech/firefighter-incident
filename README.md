FireFighter is ManoMano's in-house Incident Management Tool.

It helps manage incidents, by automatically creating a Slack channel for communication, and much more.

__What's Incident Management?__

Incident Management is a set of processes and tools to help teams detect, respond to, and resolve incidents quickly and effectively.

Incidents are unplanned interruptions or reductions in quality of services, like a service outage or a security breach.
