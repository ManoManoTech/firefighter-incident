__What's Incident Management?__

Incident Management is a set of processes and tools to help teams detect, respond to, and resolve incidents quickly and effectively.

Incidents are unplanned interruptions or reductions in quality of services, like a service outage or a security breach.

### Streamlined Slack Experience (June 2025)

We've improved the incident creation workflow in Slack:

- **üöÄ Faster incident creation**: Removed manual Critical/Normal selection step
- **üéØ Automatic process determination**: P1-P3 incidents automatically get Slack channels + Jira tickets, P4-P5 get Jira tickets only
- **‚úÖ Consistent priority handling**: No more mismatches between calculated priority and selected process
- **üß™ Better testing support**: Configurable for test environments without Slack usergroups

The workflow is now: **Select Impacts** ‚Üí **Auto-calculated Priority & Process** ‚Üí **Add Details** ‚Üí **Create Incident**
