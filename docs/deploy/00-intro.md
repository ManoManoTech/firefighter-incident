# Deployment Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Deployment Guide for our open-source Django and Celery application. As you embark on the journey of deploying our application, it's important to have a clear understanding of the current stage of its open-sourcing phase. Our application has been actively deployed for over two years at ManoMano, but please be aware that this open-sourcing endeavor is still in its early stages.

## FireFighter as a standalone application

FireFighter is a standalone application, and we don't recommend that you try to deploy it alongside other Django applications. It's possible, but it's not something we support.

## Navigating the Open-Sourcing Phase

While our application has a history of successful deployment, it's essential to acknowledge that certain aspects, such as testing and compatibility with diverse use cases and deployment options, might still be evolving. We recognize that deployment might not be straightforward for all scenarios, and we are actively working to improve the documentation to make this process as smooth as possible.

## The Imperfect State of Testing

Let's be honest about the current state of testing: while it has been tested within our in-house environment, open-sourcing brings new variables and configurations that might not have been thoroughly explored. This means that potential pitfalls or unexpected behavior could arise during deployment. Test suite still has many gaps, and we are working to improve it.

## Your Contributions Matter

As we continue to refine and enhance our open-source application, we invite you to actively participate in its development. Your insights, experiences, and expertise are invaluable in making this application more robust and versatile. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, there are several ways you can contribute:

- **Open Issues**: If you encounter challenges or inconsistencies during deployment, open an issue on our repository. This helps us identify pain points and work towards resolving them.

- **Initiate Discussions**: If you have questions, ideas, or suggestions related to deployment, start a discussion on our forums. Engaging with the community can lead to valuable insights and improvements.

- **Submit Pull Requests**: If you've identified ways to enhance the deployment documentation, configurations, or processes, we encourage you to submit pull requests. Your contributions can make a significant impact on the overall experience of our users.

## Embracing a Collaborative Effort

We believe that the open-source community's strength lies in collaboration. By sharing your deployment experiences, suggesting improvements, and actively participating in discussions, you contribute to the growth of a resource that benefits everyone.

Thank you for joining us in this exciting phase of open-sourcing our application. Your engagement and contributions are instrumental in shaping its future.
