# Contributing guidelines

## Foreword

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

It's worth mentioning that the purpose of this document is to provide you with a set of general guidelines and not
strict rules: nothing is set in stone and we welcome contributions about these contributing guidelines as well :-)

## TL;DR

We want to make contributing straightforward and easy for everyone. As such and unless otherwise stated, we will use the
traditional GitHub fork and pull request workflow: any commit must be made to a feature/topic branch in a local fork and
submitted via a pull request before it can be merged. If you are familiar with GitHub (and Git), branching and opening a
pull request or an issue... then you should be able to start contributing right away.

It is **strongly advised** to contact the project owner(s) **before** working on implementing a new feature or making
any kind of large code refactoring.

Contributors must agree to the following:

- material without explicit copyright assignment will be assigned to [ManoMano](https://manomano.fr)
- apart from a few identified exceptions, material must be licensed under the project's MIT license (see [LICENSE](../license.md))

Contributors must also agree to follow the [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Coding style

> Refer to the [development guidelines](development.md) for more information.

## Documentation

We consider documentation as important as code. Substantial contribution must always come with exhaustive documentation.

> Refer to the [documentation guidelines](documentation.md) for more information.

## Tests

Application and contributions should be tested and push for the highest quality standard.

> Refer to the [development guidelines](development.md#testing) for more information.

## Git

See [development guidelines](development.md#git) for more information about the Git workflow.

## Issues

If you find a bug that you don't know how to fix, please create an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/):

- use a clear and descriptive title
- give a step by step explanation on how to reproduce the problem
- include as many details as possible, even ones that may seem irrelevant; [gists](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/) are a good way to include large amount of context and information
- describe what was already tried to fix the problem

> These contribution guidelines are adapted from the [ManoMano CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/ManoManoTech/ALaMano/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) repository.
