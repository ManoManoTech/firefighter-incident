# Modern Features and System Architecture

This document explains the modern features and improvements introduced since v0.0.2.

## Component and Priority System Overhaul

### Enhanced Priority System (P1-P5)

FireFighter now uses a modernized priority system with clear Critical/Normal distinction:

**Critical Incidents (P1-P3):**
- Automatic Slack channel creation
- Jira ticket creation
- Immediate notifications
- SRE team involvement

**Normal Incidents (P4-P5):**
- Jira ticket only
- Standard notification flow
- Self-service resolution

### Component Classification

We've completely restructured the component system:

```python
# New component structure with business categories
components = {
    "Data & Analytics": ["Data Tools", "Analytics Engine", "BI Platform"],
    "Customer Experience": ["Frontend", "Mobile App", "Customer Portal"],
    "Infrastructure": ["Kubernetes", "Databases", "Monitoring"],
    # ... 61+ components mapped to Slack usergroups
}
```

### Slack Usergroup Integration

Automatic mapping between components and Slack usergroups:

```python
# Component → Slack usergroup mapping
component_slack_mapping = {
    "payments": "@payments-team",
    "catalog": "@catalog-team", 
    "infrastructure": "@sre-team",
    # Automatically synced with Slack workspace
}
```

## Impact Level System

### Granular Impact Selection

New impact levels provide better incident classification:

```python
class ImpactLevel(models.Model):
    NONE = "NO"  # No impact
    LOW = "LOW"
    MEDIUM = "MED" 
    HIGH = "HIGH"
    CRITICAL = "CRIT"
    
    # Business-specific impact categories
    CUSTOMER_FACING = "CUSTOMER"
    INTERNAL_TOOLS = "INTERNAL"
    DATA_PROCESSING = "DATA"
```

### Automatic Priority Calculation

Impact levels automatically determine incident priority:

```python
def calculate_priority_from_impacts(impacts: List[ImpactLevel]) -> Priority:
    """Calculate priority based on highest impact level."""
    max_impact = max(impacts, key=lambda x: x.severity_weight)
    
    if max_impact.severity_weight >= 4:
        return Priority.P1  # Critical
    elif max_impact.severity_weight >= 3:
        return Priority.P2  # High
    # ... automatic calculation
```

## Streamlined Slack UX

### Removed Manual Steps

The incident creation workflow has been streamlined:

**Before:**
1. Select impacts
2. **Manual Critical/Normal selection** ← Removed
3. Fill details
4. Create incident

**After:**
1. Select impacts → Auto-calculate priority & process
2. Fill details  
3. Create incident

### Automatic Process Determination

```python
def determine_response_type(priority: Priority) -> ResponseType:
    """Automatically determine response type from priority."""
    return "critical" if priority.value <= 3 else "normal"
```

## Test Environment Support

### Configurable Slack Integration

Support for testing environments without Slack usergroups:

```python
# Test mode configuration
if settings.TEST_MODE and not settings.ENABLE_SLACK_USERGROUPS:
    # Skip usergroup invitations
    # Auto-invite incident creator
    # Maintain core functionality
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Test environment setup
TEST_MODE=True
ENABLE_SLACK_USERGROUPS=False
APP_DISPLAY_NAME="FireFighter[TEST]"
```

## Django Components Modernization

### Type-Safe Components

Updated to modern Django components without deprecated generics:

```python
# Before: Deprecated syntax
class IncidentCard(Component[IncidentDict]):
    template_name = "components/incident_card.html"

# After: Modern syntax  
class IncidentCard(Component):
    template_name = "components/incident_card.html"
    
    def get_context_data(self, incident: Incident) -> dict:
        return {"incident": incident}
```

### Reusable Component Library

Modular component system for consistent UI:

- `components/card/` - Reusable card layouts
- `components/form/` - Form components with validation
- `components/modal/` - Modal dialogs
- `components/messages/` - Toast notifications

## Database Migration System

### Comprehensive Migrations

The system includes extensive migrations for the overhaul:

```python
# Key migrations since v0.0.2
migrations = [
    "0005_enable_from_p1_to_p5_priority.py",
    "0006_update_group_names.py", 
    "0007_update_component_name.py",
    "0008_impact_level.py",
    "0015_update_impact_level.py",
    "0016_update_business_incidents_and_level.py",
    "0017_reorder_impact_types.py",
    "0018_update_impactlevel_names.py",
]
```

### Data Preservation

All migrations preserve existing incident data while upgrading the schema:

```python
def migrate_existing_incidents(apps, schema_editor):
    """Migrate existing incidents to new component structure."""
    Incident = apps.get_model("incidents", "Incident")
    for incident in Incident.objects.all():
        # Map old component to new component
        # Preserve all incident history
        # Update relationships
```

## Build System Improvements

### Modern Frontend Pipeline

Enhanced build system with modern tools:

```javascript
// rollup.config.js - Modern JS bundling
export default {
    input: 'src/js/main.js',
    output: {
        file: 'static/js/bundle.js',
        format: 'iife'
    },
    plugins: [
        babel(),
        terser(),
        // ... modern plugins
    ]
};
```

### PDM Package Management

Comprehensive script system for all development needs:

```toml
# pyproject.toml - Organized scripts
[tool.pdm.scripts]
dev-env-setup = {composite = ["dev-env-start", "migrate", "loaddata", "createsuperuser", "collectstatic"]}
build-web = "npm run build"
lint = {composite = ["lint-ruff", "lint-pylint", "lint-mypy"]}
```

## Performance and Observability

### Enhanced Logging

Structured logging with context:

```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)

def create_incident(data):
    logger.info(
        "incident.create.started",
        incident_id=incident.id,
        component=incident.component.name,
        priority=incident.priority.value,
    )
```

### Metrics Collection

Improved incident metrics:

```python
class IncidentMetrics:
    def calculate_mttr(self, component: Component) -> timedelta:
        """Calculate MTTR for component with trend analysis."""
        
    def business_impact_score(self, incident: Incident) -> float:
        """Calculate business impact based on affected systems."""
```
