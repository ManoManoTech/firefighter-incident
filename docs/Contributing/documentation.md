# Documentation

Substantial contribution must always come with exhaustive documentation. We consider documentation as important as code.
***REMOVED***

If you see mistake or lack of information on a part of the project documentation, you can add it in the Confluence space. If it's a technical part, you can add it directly in the repository via a merge request (see the [development guideline](development.md))

## Documentation Formatting

Although formatting is not enforced on the documentation, feel free to use the [VS Code extension `markdownlint`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) to keep the Markdown style consistent.
