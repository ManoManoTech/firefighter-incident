### Icons

FireFighter web uses icons from [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/), solid style. For consistency, use them as much as possible.

### Color-scheme

FireFighter web supports both light and dark theme, following the browser CSS feature `prefers-colors-scheme`. Make sure everything is legible and good-looking in both themes.
