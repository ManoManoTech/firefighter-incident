## Web UI

## Tailwind CSS

Firefighter uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

We use some [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) components. Ask the [Pulse Team](https://manomano-team.slack.com/archives/CL3JAED88) if you need access to the Tailwind UI account.
<!-- XXX OSS Don't ask the Pulse Team -->

!!! info "For VSCode users"
    Feel free to use the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) VSCode extension to get autocompletion and linting.

### Icons

FireFighter web uses icons from [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/), solid style. For consistency, use them as much as possible.

### Color-scheme

FireFighter web supports both light and dark theme, following the browser CSS feature `prefers-colors-scheme`. Make sure everything is legible and good-looking in both themes.
