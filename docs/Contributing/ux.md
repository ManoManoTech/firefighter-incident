# UX Flow & Design

- If you have idea to improve the UX flow or the design of the FireFighter Tool, you can open a new Github issue or discussion.
- If you don't already have an idea for a UX improvement, you can pick an existing problem to work on from the issue list. Be sure to comment and verify that no one else is working on the UX for the issue, and to make sure weâ€™re still interested in a given contribution. You can validate this with the project owner(s).

- The request will be studied by the project owner(s) and will come back to you to ask question to clarify the request & validate the good understanding of the request.

- After the implementation, you will be able to go see and test this idea in preview with the team in test environment!

- After this validation, the request can go into production and make life easier for all users when they manage an incident!

## Design guidelines

- All actions taking place during the incident resolution must be able to be done via the Slack App.
  - Some of these actions may be doable through other means (e.g.: opening an incident through Slack, but also API or Web UI.)
- Actions taking place after the incident resolution may be done through the Web UI, API or Back-Office.
