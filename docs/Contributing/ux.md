# UX Flow & Design

<!-- XXX OSS -->

- If you have idea to improve the UX flow or the design of the FireFighter Tool, you can open a new Jira ticket in the [FireFighter board](https://manomano.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=443).
- If you don't already have an idea for a UX improvement, you can pick an existing problem to work on from the [FireFighter board](https://manomano.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=443). Be sure to comment and verify that no one else is working on the UX for the issue, and to make sure weâ€™re still interested in a given contribution. You can validate this with the project owner(s) (Pulse Team).

- The request will be studied by the project owner(s) (Pulse team) and will come back to you to ask question to clarify the request & validate the good understanding of the request.

- After the implementation, you will be able to go see and test this idea in preview with the team in test environment!

- After this validation, the request can go into production and make life easier for all ManoMano people when they manage an incident!
